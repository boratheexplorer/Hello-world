# Hello-world
##My name is Bora and I am a beginning programmer.
####I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and urban studies from Northwestern University. I completed a dual department honors thesis on neighborhood crime and its effect on adolescent mental health, mediation via sleep. I went on to research at academic institutions like UCLA and UCSF. I have embarked on a journey toward becoming a working data scientist a couple weeks ago to expand my data analysis skills and to fulfill my curiosity with handling large data sets.
